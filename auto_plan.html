                <p class="detail">Government contracts often specify how many hours each role should work based on an estimate from the contractor. Program analysts are tasked with ensuring employees work as close to the number of funded hours as possible.

Fortunately for me, <b>predicting the exact number of hours an employee will need is practically impossible.</b> Even if it weren't, numerous factors affect an employee's availability, like unexpected absences, project delays, and demand on other projects. So <b>program analysts must constantly adapt their plans</b> in response to unexpected deviations.

              <h2 class="project-section-title">Approach</h2>

              <p class="detail">
                We applied a Design Thinking approach tailored to our team's constraints.

                <div class="full-width-ol">
                <ol class="project-approach-list">
                  <div class="project-approach-bullet">
                  <b><li>Empathize</li></b>
                  <p>
                  I started with <b>user interviews and observation sessions</b> to help our team understand user workflows and pain points. We discovered that program analysts typically adjust one of three variables to account for deviations from a plan: an employee's future level of effort, end date, or total hours. We also learned that users frequently rely on external spreadsheets to perform calculations PACT Planner does not support, then manually input that data back into PACT Planner.
                    </p>


              <div class="pswp-gallery project-image autoplan-gallery">
                <a href="img/autoplan/user-observation-session.png" data-pswp-width="1919" data-pswp-height="776">

                <div class="project-image-caption">Screenshot of a user observation session</div>
              </div>
              <p>
                Then, I designed a <b>usability test</b> to simulate the planning and maintenance of a typical project.  I tested with 6 of our product team members, mostly because of restricted access to real users but also to cultivate empathy toward users. The test's tediousness proved rhetorically effective for team members skeptical about the severity of the problem.
              </p>
              </div>
                   
                    
              <div class="project-approach-bullet">
                  <b><li>Define</li></b>
                  <p>
                    I <b>labeled and organized pain points</b> and errors from usability testing/user observation sessions in our research repository to illustrate the distinct pain points users face. 
                  </p>
                  <div class="pswp-gallery project-image autoplan-gallery">

                    <p>
                      Next, I created <b>UX maps</b> to illustrate user workflows and identify inefficiencies. This process highlighted that eliminating spreadsheets and manual data entry from users' workflows would save them significant amounts of time and reduce task complexity.

                <p>
                  Before creating visual designs, I brainstormed solutions in broad strokes with a colleague. We settled on the idea of an auto-updating plan and explored how it might work across different contract types and planning strategies.
                </p>

            <h2 class="project-section-title">Solution</h2>
            <p>
            To help users manage spend plans more efficiently, we developed Auto-Plan—a feature that <b>automatically creates and maintains employee hour allocations.</b> Auto-Plan adapts as employees log hours, continuously adjusting to ensure employees are planned to meet their allocated hours.
            </p>
            <video class="project-video" autoplay playsinline loop muted onclick="this.paused?this.play():this.pause();">
              <source src="img/autoplan/auto-plan-demo.mov">
              Using the auto-plan popover, a user changes the fixed parameter to LOE. The burnout date automatically updates to a new date. The user clicks save, and the hours on the data table behind the popover change.
            </video>
            <p>
            <b>Users can customize how Auto-Plan makes adjustments.</b> They can choose to fix either an employee's end date or level of effort, and Auto-Plan will adjust the other. For instance, if an employee with a fixed level of effort works less than planned in the first few pay periods of a project, PACT Planner will extend their end date. If that employee instead had a fixed end date, PACT Planner would decrease their planned hours for future pay periods.
            </p>

            <b>Users can override the Auto-Plan hours for any pay period</b> and Auto-Plan will automatically adapt to ensure employees are planned to meet their allocated hours. It's also easy to preview the effect an override will have on the burnout date or future level of effort. Overriding helps users refine Auto-Plan's work when they have more accurate predictions for the future.

            <p class="detail">
              This feature is not yet released, but <b>users responded very positively</b> to demonstrations:

              <p>
                We anticipate that Auto-Plan will save users about three hours of work annually for a typical contract. Considering users manage dozens of contracts each year, I expect this feature will significantly increase user <b>satisfaction, efficiency, and effectiveness</b> when using PACT Planner.
